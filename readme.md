## Usage
After installation, you can start using ComfyUI-EsesImageResize in your projects. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```python
from comfyui_eses_image_resize import ImageResizer

# Initialize the resizer
resizer = ImageResizer()

# Resize an image
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", target_size=(800, 600))
```

This code snippet initializes the image resizer and resizes an image to 800x600 pixels.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the features:

### Scale by Ratio
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", scale_ratio=0.5)
```

### Target Megapixels
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", target_megapixels=1.5)
```

### Fixed Dimensions
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", fixed_dimensions=(1024, 768))
```

### Aspect Ratio Control
To maintain the aspect ratio:
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", keep_aspect_ratio=True)
```

To ignore the aspect ratio:
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", keep_aspect_ratio=False)
```

## Framing Options
The framing options allow for better control over how images fit into their new dimensions.

### Crop to Fit
This option will fill the new dimensions, cropping the image as necessary:
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", framing_option="crop_to_fit")
```

### Fit to Frame
This option will fit the image within the new dimensions, adding letterboxing or pillarboxing as needed:
```python
resized_image = resizer.resize("path/to/image.jpg", framing_option="fit_to_frame", background_color=(255, 255, 255))
```
